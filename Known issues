Currently the program is bugged because eql? needs to be overwritten for ruby hash structures to be user created keys.
Since the program just needs to deal with text this can be altered. If keys are kept as strings it shouldn't be a problem.

TODO: convert array values of x, y positions to strings of the format "x, y" when placing their values into hashes; regular 
expressions should be helpful here.

The alternative would be to over write ruby's hash eql? which might be easier short term but seems prone to cause issues long term.
