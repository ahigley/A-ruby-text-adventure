# A-ruby-text-adventure

This text-adventure is a project that I am working on as I continue through CSCE 155T at UNL. 

If you want to play the old (stable) version of the game as a single file run text.rb

If you want to play the current version of the game download everything but text.rb and instead run text_exp.rb.

RECOMMENDED: Download everything; run ruby text_exp.rb
