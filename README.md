# A-ruby-text-adventure

This text-adventure is a project that I am working on as I continue through CSCE 155T at UNL.

In the latest update bootstrapping was added. Hopefully it will make the game a bit more readable (it was getting out of hand even for me). I ran a very brief test - everything seemed to still be working. 

If you want to play the current version of the game without bootstrapping just download and run text.rb

If you want to play the current version of the game with bootstrapping download everything but text.rb and instead run text_exp.rb
